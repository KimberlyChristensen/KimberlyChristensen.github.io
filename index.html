  <img width=200 src="Assets/Headshot.jpg" alt="broken link" >


  <p> I am a creative data-driven professional with a passion for learning and innovation. My professional background is varied and includes credit risk management, valuation of esoteric assets, and leading a high-performing oversight team in investment management. As a CFA charterholder, I uphold strong ethical values and operate with a client-centric attitude.
  <p> I enjoy research, reading, writing, and storytelling. Data analytics tools such as Python allow me to find the patterns in the data and tell a story.
